# memoryGame

Memory Game is a React app in which you attempt to click on unique images. If you click on all the images without duplication, then you win the game! If you click a duplicate image, then the game will reshuffle and your points will start over from 0. The challenge is in the fact that the game will shuffle the images every time you make a choice. Good luck!
